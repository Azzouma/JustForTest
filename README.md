This project includes a simple implementation of the RSA public key encryption algorithm.

It was taken from "Paj's" website:
http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/rsa/implementation.html by David Brodrick who adapted it in the link "http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Security/SimpleRSApublickeyencryptionalgorithmimplementation.htm"
